# 创建站点

## 克隆站点

Let's start with creating a blog for you. Visit _ZeroHello_, download _ZeroBlog_ if you haven't downloaded it yet, hover it, and press the epsilon. A menu appears:

-   To favourites
-   Update
-   Check files
-   Pause
-   Clone
-   Delete

Press _Clone_. Your new blog appears. That's practically all about cloning.

### 更改 ZeroBlog

You can change blog title, description, etc. by hovering them and pressing a pencil to the left.

Now, let's post something. Press _Add new post_. Edit post title, content and press _Sign & Publish new content_ button in the bottom. When you sign data, `content.json` is changed. When you publish content, you send other peers that have your zite a new version, they send them to other peers, etc.

But now nobody except you have this zite. So, things become difficult.

## 下载于更新站点

When you download a zite, ZeroNet opens your peer list and chooses those which already have this zite. For example, your second computer, which doesn't know about your first computer, wants to download your zite. How to connect these computers?

...Via _trackers_. All peers often connect to trackers in _Internet_ and tell them: we are on this IP and have these zites: `...`. So, the first computer tells some tracker about a new zite, and the second computer asks this tracker about anybody having this zite. Easy-peasy.

One more word about trackers. You need a static IP or Tor connection to share zites with other peers if these peers don't accept your zite update (for example, they don't have this zite at all).

## 代理

Anybody can connect to your blog while there is a running computer (serving your zite). But you probably want to shutdown it at night. So it's a good idea to have a computer always working.

Fortunately, there are such computers: _ZeroNet proxies_. [0net.io](https://0net.io) is one of them. You should use them as you use local ZeroNet. On proxies, _ZeroTalk_ address is `https://0net.io/1TaLkFrMwvbNsooF4ioKAY9EuxTBTjipT`

When your blog is ready, visit `https://0net.io/{zite public key}/`. You can get public key from address bar: `http://127.0.0.1:43110/{zite public key}/`.

Available proxies: [0net.io](https://0net.io), [@amorgan's proxy](http://zn.amorgan.xyz) and [ZeroGate](https://zerogate.tk).

## .bit 地址

Every zite can be accessed via public key (e.g. `1TaLkFrMwvbNsooF4ioKAY9EuxTBTjipT` for _ZeroTalk_). Hosting such zites takes no price. But you probably don't think `1TaLkFrMwvbNsooF4ioKAY9EuxTBTjipT` is a nice address what if you could have `zerotalk.com`?

...In fact, you can do that via _Namecoin_. _Namecoin_ is based on blockchain. If you want to register `.bit` address (for price), you should download a _Namecoin_ client and make a `.bit` address there (only `.bit` suffix is supported).

If you don't want to host a _Namecoin_ client and host the whole blockchain, you can use online services to host domains, such as Dotbit.me and Peername.

As majority has _Namecoin_ plugin enabled, you can access _ZeroTalk_ via `http://127.0.0.1:43110/Talk.ZeroNetwork.bit/`.

You can check registered `.bit` addresses at [ZeroName](http://127.0.0.1:43110/zeroname.bit/`).

## 练习

Try to clone _ZeroTalk_ and make your own zite.
